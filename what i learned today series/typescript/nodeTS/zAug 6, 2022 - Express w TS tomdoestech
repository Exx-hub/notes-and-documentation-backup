Express w TS - TomDoesTech

----major takeaway => need to master or be good enough with node before doing node TS!!

// @ts-ignore 
=> to bypass ts error on next line. use this just for setting up the code first before implementing strict Typing


1. tsc --init

2. npm init

3. mkdir src

4. touch src/app.ts

5. Install tsnode or ts-node dev and typescript as devdependencies

---npm i -D ts-node-dev typescript @types/express @types/node

6. Add in script in package.json

-- "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/app.ts"

7. install express

8. initial bootstrap and add the basic routes and express middleware

9. type the request and response objects


node express topics
-basic bootstrap config
-express.json to parse from request body
-basic routes
-response and request object
-TS typing
-route chaining
-dynamic routes / route parameters
- route handlers

-middleware ==> function that gets called in the route that also has access to request and response objects.
            ==> need to call next() to proceed.
