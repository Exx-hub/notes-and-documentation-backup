React TS tictactoe tomdoestech


npx create-react-app . --template typescript



*Array(9).fill(null) => array of 9 null values



how each square is filled with value:


  // what this does is basically, compare the squares array to a created squares array copy
  // if the index matches, changes the current value of that index to current player string which is X or O
  // if index does not match, just return it's value. either null if not yet clicked or X or O if already clicked prior
  // after this compare and populate, sets new array to state
  // and changes current player
  const setSquareValue = (i: number) => {
    const newData = squares.map((val, index) => {
      if (i === index) {
        return currentPlayer;
      }

      return val;
    });
    
    
    --- compared to my implementation, this is way cleaner and better
    
    -- this is how react docs implemented it hehehe
    
    -- kinda like practice of react ts and js logic nalang din.
