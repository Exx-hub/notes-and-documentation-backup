what i learned today:

-using useImperativeValue 
- when using modals, to prevent re-renders of parent component esp if it will cause rerender of all children component
- when toggling the modal. 
- by using refs and forward ref and imperative value, only the modal component will re-render when toggled


-custom hooks
-useAxios custom hook
-custom hooks in general
- just like react component or just a function that returns something and can be used in component
- state of custom hooks are state of component calling the hook.
- so component calling the custom hooks re-renders even when state is in custom hook, and when it is updated.


reducer

-in useReducer in react, need to pass initial state as 2nd parameter
- in redux, pass initial state in reducer function as default of state param
- but in RTK, initial state is passed in createSlice

better to use reducer for state if you have many pieces of state and setter functions which you need to pass. for example if you have 3 pieces of state you need to pass as props, you already need to pass 6 props including setter functions of the state

GIT - collaboration
-when collobrating with git, when working on same file, it's okay as long as you do not touch lines or part of other person's changes. 
- better to not work on the same file, but on the same project is okay
