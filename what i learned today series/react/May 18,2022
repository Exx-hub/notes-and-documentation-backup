TODAY's LEARNING:

-using javascript default parameter value
-it should be undefined or none to work
-will not work if null or empty string


CUSTOM HOOKS:
-basically these are just functions that you can reuse in your components
-this will hold logic and state
-so instead of having the state and logic in the component, you move it to a custom hook.
-by doing this, you can reuse this logic and state to other components.

-but remember, state in custom hooks are owned by component calling them.
-updating the state will re-render the component calling the hook
