React Composition

-it is making component more generic and reusable by passing props to a component to display dynamic data , esp when reused.
-you probably have been using it but not know the concept or concept name.

-usually used with props.children. but can also be used with other props to make component more specific / generic.

-one example would be a card component.
-in one instance displayed or rendered without image and in another part of your project it can have an image.

-image is passed as prop in one instance. and card component checks if props do include an image.

<CardComponent title="alvin" image={<img src="/logos/logo.svg" />}/>

<CardComponent title="acosta" description="blah blah blah" />

so in one part cards have an image, and in another section cards have no image but has a description.
