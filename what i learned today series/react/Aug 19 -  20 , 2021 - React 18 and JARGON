Dave Gray React 18


--since react 18 now has automatic state batching, there is an option to opt-out
--if you want separate renders for multiple state updates => use flushSync



Web Dev Simp
•useTransition - to set high priority or low prio and separate state updates to display not block ui


•useDeferredValue

like debounce and throttle

Automatic Batching
 
 opting out => flushSync
 
 
Concurrent React
-pause and resume rendering
-react can interrupt, pause or abandon a render

-an example is a call with mommy usually takes long, then someone from work calls (urgent and quick),
-you can put mom on hold, then take the urgent call, just a quick one. then continue convo with mom. 


Transitions
- used for slow rendering
- slow network


Suspense on the server
- code splitting on the server
- this example is the one like a dashboard with multiple sections.
- if one section loads slow, before this feature, it waits for everything to be finished before displaying ui
- with this, other sections can be displayed while the slow one is served with a loader or spinner while waiting. hmm

- one slow part doesnt slow down the whole page
- show initial HTML early and stream the rest
- code splitting fully intergrated with server rendering




REACT JARGON -

1. render phase => commit phase -- diff and reconciliation
2. state
3. side effects - any other code that is not directly related creating or manipulating JSX are side effects
4. purity. - put side effects in useEffect to keep component pure
5. idempotence and heuristics?***
6. concurrency



Debounce and throttling
