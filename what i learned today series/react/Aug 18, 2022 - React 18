features of react 18 need to learn:

in app.js

ReactDom.render => const root =  ReactDOM.createRoot

root.render.



no other changes required. all will still work the same way, assuming you will not use new features.



Features:

1. concurrency
- state update prioritization.
 - some state updates can be done first instead of state updates in the order they were triggered.
 - causes slow updates if some state changes are blocking or takes a long time to finish like if with an api call
 
 
 how to use or tell react to use concurrency -
 
 => Concurrent APIs:
 
 •useTransition() - FC
 startTransition() - class components where hooks cant be used
 -tell react that some state update may be handled with a lower prio
 
 how to use - wrap a state to let react know that it may be handled with a lower prio
 •startTransition(() => setSelectedUser(iser));
 -- tells react that it should not wait for this state update to finish before processing other state updates
 -- the wrapped state update will have a lower prio. usually state updates that take a long time to finish
 
 •useDeferredValue()
 - tell react that an older value should be displayed until a new updated value is ready
 - instead of the entire component waiting for new value to be availble
 
 
 urgent updates vs transition updates
 urgent updates - clicking, typing - real time events -- should be prioritized. not waiting for transition
 transition updates - updates that can wait, not instant
 
 
 2. useId
   - not meant for keys in lists.
   - used for html ids to match htmlFor
 
 
 3. automatic state batching
 	- grouping multiple state updates together, so they are executed as one instaed of multiple
 	-if batched multiple state changes, the component will only re-render once
 
 4. Suspense
 - manages loading state of components
  - something like for dynamic render of loading when fetching data.
  - this provides fallback when data is not ready
  
  -cool!
 
 5. server components - coming soon!
