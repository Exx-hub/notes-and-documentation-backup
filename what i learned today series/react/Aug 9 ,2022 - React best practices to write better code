React Best Practices to write better code


Good Folder Structure
Maintain a structured import order
Learn different component patterns
Use a linter and follow its rules
Test your code
Integrate Typescript (or at least use default props and prop types)
Use lazy-loading / code splitting (webpack bundling)
Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
Handle errors effectively
Keep your key prop unique across your whole app

cherries on top:
Implement the useReducer hook earlier
 Use shorthand for boolean props
Avoid curly braces for string props
Erase non-html attributes when spreading props
Use Snippets tsrpfc rafce rfce etc
Write a fragment when a div is not needed
 Integrate self closing tags when no children are needed
 Follow common naming conventions
Use camelCase for JavaScript data types like variables, arrays, objects, functions, and so on
