DAVE GRAY MERN STACK - TECHNOTES


KEY Features and Tech Used:

---FE----

•React Router v6 
- nested routing
- wrapper components / route
- Outlet
- Public routes , Protected Routes

• RTK Query
- central api slice => create api
- extended api slices for other features (inject endpoints)
- entity adapter 
- builder.query and builder.mutation
- onQueryStarted

-providesTags and invalidatesTags for data refetch

Data Revalidation on useQuery:
pollingInterval: 10000, 
refetchOnFocus: true,
refetchOnMountOrArgChange: true,


• RTK
- createSlice
- selectors and actions
- global state, save data like Auth Data.


•Persist login on refresh --

what is keeping me logged in? cookies or token? or local storage?
-- first is persist true in local storage
-- 2nd is token - if persist is true, token gets refreshed with refresh endpoint


TechNotes
-if persist value in local storage is true, then user refreshes
-PersistLogin component remounts, but token from global state is cleared.
- useEffect in PersistLogin will run, calling the refresh endpoint.

- refresh endpoint uses refreshToken stored in cookie.

- if this refresh is successful, will return a new access token and save to global state.
- allowing persist of login after refresh.


EDS 
- userProfile Class Object always initialized.
- gets data from local storage
- on every refresh, just uses getItem on local storage every time to get credentials and store in userProfile Class object


So, EDS uses local storage. Tech notes uses refresh token and cookie, also local storage somehow.
