manual testing vs unit testing / automation testing

importance of testing:

1. catch bugs
2. increases confidence of application
3. speeds up QA time
4. can serve as documentations


types of tests:

1. Unit Tests
2. Integration Tests
3. End to End Tests



TEST BLOCK


test("string that describes the test", () => {

   // test logic here.
})


can use "it" instead of "test". interchangeable.




test block:
1. render a component we want to test
2. find element we want to interact with
3. intercact with those elements
4. assert that the results are as expected
