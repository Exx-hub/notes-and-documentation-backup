REACT TESTING LIBRARY

-when testing a component, convention is creating a folder __test__ under the component folder. and create test file there.


it and test are the same. it block and test block

first test: 

it("should render same text passed into title prop", () => {
  render(<Header title="My Header" />);
  const headingElement = screen.getByText(/my header/i);
  expect(headingElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

--this test checks whether prop passed to title is displayed as headingElement in Header component


qeury methods like getByText, getByTestId ,getByRole
