RECT TESTING LIBRARY


-// for async element like fetched data, use find for async queries

-mock api requests



Pedro tech testing video 1.

*when testing functions, it is good practice to write multiple assertions.


test and it are the same. it is an alias of test.


if testing for components that are renderred dynamically or conditionally, getBy will not work because it will not find element if condition is false. element is not present. for this you should use queryBy

because queryBy does not return an error if no match found but returns null.




did alot of practice writing and doing tests on small components. unit testing.
