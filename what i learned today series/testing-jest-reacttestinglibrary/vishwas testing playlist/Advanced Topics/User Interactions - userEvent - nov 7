User Interactions

mouse clicks, keyboard presses

=> user-event library instead of fireEvent

fireEvent vs user-event

fireEvent is a method from RTL which is used to dispatch DOM events
user-event simulates full interactions, which may fire multiple events and do addtional checks along the way


for example, we can dispatch the change event on an input field using fireEvent,

when a user types into a textbox, the element has to be focused and then keyboard and input events are fired and the selection and value on the element are manipulated as they type

user-event allows to describe a full interaction instead of a concrete event like a single click.


user-event now user v14. refer to documentation for changes

async
const user = userEvent.setup();
await user.click(incrementBtn);
