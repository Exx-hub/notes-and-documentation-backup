INTRO TO TESTING in REACT and JAVASCRIPT

intro to jest and react testing libary


What are the different type of Tests?

Unit Testing

Tests one unit of code at a time. May be a single function or a component without depending on other units
Integration Testing

Tests how multiple units work together. Testing interaction between different functions/units/components
Functional / Behavioural Testing

Functional testing means testing the behaviour of a function/software. We might be testing if the software does the right thing with the particular set of data. That might be an integration test as it might have to interact with different units. So the functional test can be an integration test as well

The functional test can also be a simple unit test. Let's say on a button click, the div turns red. This might be a simple unit test but still it can also be considered as a functional test as it tests for a particular behaviour of CLICK TURNS RED OR NOT

So, the functional test means, not testing the code but testing the behaviour. React-Testing-Library encourages functional tests

Acceptance/End-to-End(E2E) test

This is an End-to-End testing where we need a browser and might also need the server

Popular tools for E2E testing are Cypress and Selenium

React-Testing-Library doesn't support E2E testing.



=====


React Testing Library is not an alternative to Jest, because they need each other and every one of them has a clear task.

Jest is a test runner, which gives you the ability to run tests with Jest from the command line. In addition, Jest offers you functions for test suites, test cases, and assertions. React Testing Library, in contrast to Jest, is one of the testing libraries to test React components.

If you are using create-react-app, Jest (and React Testing Library) comes by default with the installation. If you are using a custom React setup, you need to install and set up Jest (and React Testing Library) yourself.

Building a unit test

Unit tests test individual software units or components in isolation. A unit could be a function, routine, method, module, or object, and the test objective determines if the unit outputs the expected results for a given input.

A test module comprises a series of methods provided by Jest to describe the testsâ€™ structure. We can use methods like describe or test as follows:


describe('my function or component', () => {   // test suite
 test('does the following', () => {            // test / test case
   // Magic happens here
 });
});
