NEXT JS blog project

-playing around with markdown and converting into jsx/html

-installed react syntax highlighter
 --creates code snippet from markdown.
 
 
 
 ---continue with module and proceed with modifications after all vids
 
 
 
 useRef vs useState for forms
 
 uncontrolled vs controlled input
 
 There are pros and cons.

-If you you keep form values in state (aka controlled components) one benefit is you can for example immediately access values on change, for example if you want to have some button disabled in case user types something in the input box.

-If you take ref approach (aka uncontrolled components) one benefit is that you don't have to re render your component each time user types (because calling state update does a re render).

AFAIK react recommends controlled components, but uncontrolled ones are an alternative too.


---so this is situational. if you need the page to re-render on every key stroke for example, or get the value of the input for every key pressed, use use state.

-- if you need the values of the inputs on every current value, use controlled. also for validation.

---if you only need the value when the user has finished and you dont really need a re-render useRef is good too.

so basically case specific.




ASYNC AWAIT -

-normally code is run synchronously. line by line. does not wait for results of a function for example.
-that's why callback or .then were made (promises). for code to wait for the result of something before continuing.

-same with async await. will wait for the result of a promise before continuing execution.
