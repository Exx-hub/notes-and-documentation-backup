- udemy next js series and some of codedamn advanced nextjs

what i learned today:

-classes are not in react dev tools components
-getServersideProps are run from the server before the html/view, and is run on every request

-.env.local .development .production
-need to restart app for env vars to take effect


-to setup env variables - create .env.local file


-if you need to access env vars in the browser/frontend -

it should be name NEXT_PUBLIC_<variableName>

ex.

SECRET_VARIABLE=codedamn.com --- only accessible to the backend/server or in getServersideProps

NEXT_PUBLIC_SECRET_VARIABLE=alvinacosta.com --- this can be accessed from the frontend/browser

-need to restart the app whenever env vars are updated. since they are ran at build time. SSR


.ENV.LOCAL VS .DEVELOPMENT VS .PRODUCTION

-env.local will ovewrite .development if they have same variables 



-next intro/refresher

-nothing much for today
