API Routes?

next api routes vs express? hmm


controlled vs uncontrolled input

controlled - handled by react component with useState and onChange
uncontrolled - handled by ref, getting ref.current.value


JSON.stringify vs JSON.parse

Stringify() is used to convert the Object into JSON, --- to send or write data to a JSON file/object
Parse() is used to convert JSON into js Object --- to convert json to useable object in JS or client


stringify() takes a JavaScript object and then transforms it into a JSON string. JSON. parse() takes a JSON string and then transforms it into a JavaScript object.


status 201 - request was successful and a resource has been created.
status code 304 - requested resource has not been modified since last making a request, so browser is using previously 
		  cached version/data to speed up request handling.
		  
		  - if for example getting data from a database, and new data is present, status should be 200.
		  
example - fetching list of users that you previously fetched. (3 users for example.) if you fetch again, and there are still only 3 users, status would be 304 since browser knows that resource did not change.
but when a new user is added in the database, making it 4 users, and you fetch another request, you get 4 users
and 200 status code.
