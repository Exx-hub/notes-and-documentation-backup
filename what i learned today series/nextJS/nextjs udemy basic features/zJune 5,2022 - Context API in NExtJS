React Context API in NExtJS app

using logevents project



-use/managing global state in next JS using react context API


-creating helper function or file, to separate object / object values,
-to make code cleaner rather than verbose code and unclean.

-compared implementation to Maximillian's... pretty much the same. you did it!



-notification values and visibility depends on global state. when global state values change, notification
reacts to these state changes.


http request errors will not cause promise to fail..that's why catch block notification does not trigger...
you can block or catch error in response before res.json()

you can check if res.ok is true or false, if false throw error.

new project time!
