Review MongoDb setup and integration to NextJS

mongo uri
mongoClient
create new mongoClient and pass mongouri

you then have active client object

client.connect() to connect to database

once connected,

const db = client.db(dbName) --- use db method on client object and pass dbName 
			--- which is the database name in your mongodb cluster you want to add a collection to
			
once you have db ---- use collection method and pass collection name. to access collection in your database

for example you want to access the emails collection in your events database


Cluster > Database > Collection

Cluster1 > EventsProject > emails
