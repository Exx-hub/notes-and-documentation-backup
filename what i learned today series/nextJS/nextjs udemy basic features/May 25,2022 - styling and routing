to change the port of development mode in next js
-in package.json => "dev": "next dev -p 3001" or any port number you want


if you dont explicitly add an anchor tag in a Link component, under the hood next js places an anchor tag there
-but if you explicitly put an anchor tag, nextjs knows not to add additional anchor tag and will use the one you added

-just played around with some javascript

some next routing and css styling for next js

also some html

useRef was also used

react components
reusable react components

SUMMARY:
next js routing and styling!
