Doing Next JS Blog Project



-key points:

-using mark down to render data instead of html
- installed react-markdown
- installed gray matter


-using the project filesystem as a storage for markdown files instead of using an external database


-- tried to use getStaticProps in the Featured component so as not to pass props anymore, but it did not work

because getStaticProps and getServerSideProps will only work in page components. not in regular components


-in markdown can not explicitly put quotes for strings



--- to get the data from markdown files, we use serverside code, path and fs to read directory and read files.
--- put this in a function and run in getStaticProps or getServerSideProps
--- cannot run in client side because of fs and path etc.


params vs query -

in url - query is usually key value pairs with ?

?catergory=sports

params are values after /

---i think.


in next js
- in getStaticProps context object contains params property with slug
- in getServerSideProps context object has the whole request object - both with query and params



----plain javascript serverside code. calling functions using functions etc
