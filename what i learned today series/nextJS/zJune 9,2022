Next JS Project

-Image component src property

- either do it the normal react way wherein you import

import me from "../../public/me4.jpg"; as a variable and point to path of public folder


or

src="/me4.jpg" // automatically points at public root. so no need to add /public

since Image components point at public root so just do this.


image width and height - either add these in the Image components properties or still do the dimensions in your css



---look into rendering of next js components with props from slug or query, when you refresh you lose props passed making
the props passed undefined, causing an error.



getSTaticPaths - params: { id: item.id }


if you do not put the id or the name of the slug you use for dynamic routes, next will not know which pages it will
statically generate in advance.
