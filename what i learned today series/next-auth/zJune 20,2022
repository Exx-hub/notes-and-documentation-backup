NExt JS AUthentication


1. Server-side sessions
-store unique odentifier on server, send to client
-client uses identifier along with request when requesting or accessing protected resources


2. Authentication Tokens 
- create but not store "permission" token on server, send token to client 
-client uses token along with request when requesting or accessing protected resources


SPAs usually work with Tokens instead of sessions
1. Pages are served directly and populated with logic without hitting the server
2. Backend APIs work in a "stateless" way...they dont care about connected clients 

servers dont save info about authenticatd clients, instead, client should get information that allows them to prove their authentication. ---- JWT Json Web Tokens


JWT
- issuer data
- custom data
- secret (secret signing key) --client never sees this key. only server knows this

--when these 3 are combined, jwt is formed. 
-- signed but not encrypted
