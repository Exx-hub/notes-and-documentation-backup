Next Auth Continuation

---api practice for creating users

-install bycrypt

-encrypting password before saving to database
-checking if email exists before creating user

-status 422 for invalid or incomplete form values -- unprocessable entity


---using next auth
=> create catch all route in api folder also under auth folder. install next auth library


im slowly wrapping my head around next auth.
---historically, most common method of authentication is email and password.
---save in database using a backend server like express.

---next auth is an authentication system with much more features and complexity than email password alone.
--features like google login and much more. pero basically it's just like a login api.



add type="button" to a button in form to disable default behavior of submitting the form.
