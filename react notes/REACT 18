REACT 18:

major version

-Automatic improvements
-Concurrency Features
-Foundation for future

-you wont have to change your code or re-learn everything
-what you learned still applies you still write react code the same way as before

how to update:

npm install react@18 react-dom@18



import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'


ReactDOM.render(<App /> , document.getElementById('root'))

into---


import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<App />)



***This is the only change required. no other change.



New Features:

1. Concurrency
- a new concept and set of features (and APIs) that help with state update prioritization
- urgent state updates can be prioritized over less urgent, long taking (blocking) updates

Concurrency APIs:
useTransition()
startTransition()
useDeferredValue()

New Hooks for library authors:
useSyncExternalStore()
useInsertionEffect()
useId()


State Batching - grouping state changes, avoids multiple rerenders?

Improved Suspense?
