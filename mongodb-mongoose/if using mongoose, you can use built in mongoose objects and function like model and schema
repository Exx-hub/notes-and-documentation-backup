mongodb in node with mongoose model vs mongodb in nextjs

if using mongoose, you can use built in mongoose objects and function like model and schema.

but in next js app, no mongoose but mongodb only.

the way to connect is by creating a new MongoClient
-passing database name
-passing collection name

---in mongoose these are done by models and schema


-compare full stacks apps or node js apps

with

-nextjs apps using mongodb.



the way to connect and specify database and collection is different.
