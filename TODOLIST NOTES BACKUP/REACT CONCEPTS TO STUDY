11. useImperativeHandle

use when using modals to prevent re-renders of parent component when modal is toggled.

use this especially if parent component has a lot of child components getting re-rendered every time modal is toggled.

1. create ref using useRef
2. pass to custom component 
3. use ForwardRef on custom component 
4. use useImperativeHandle and create function to toggle modal
5. add state in custom component for visibility toggle
6. use created function in parent component
7. will not cause a re-render of the parent when modal is toggled.


12. useState vs useRef

useRef - preserve value between renders

in forms, use useRef if you dont need re-renders such as in validation of forms etc.

if you need such, also if you need the value of input on every key stroke, useState is better
