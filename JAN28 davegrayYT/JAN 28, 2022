JANUARY 28 - DAVE GRAY YT NODE FULL COURSE


NODE JS vs VANILLA JS
1. Node runs on the server - not in a browser (backend not frontend)
2. console is in terminal window
3. node has global object instead of window object
4. has common core modules - os, path, fs
5. CommonJs modules instead of es6 -require*
6. Missing some JS aPIs like fetch

READ AND WRITE FILES
const fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile


node is asynchronous, non-blocking, single threaded

-can control the order of operation by putting succeeding functions inside callbacks
- but be careful of callback hell

- handle with ASYNC AWAIT
