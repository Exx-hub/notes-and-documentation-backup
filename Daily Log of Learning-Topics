*something needs to change.
-need to make a study schedule. 4 complete hours a day?

8-9 am
1-2 pm
3-4 pm
5-6 pm
or
*6-7 pm


- follow a more structured learning..



=============================================================================================================
Current Tech Stack:

ReactJS w ecosystem
NextJS
Typescript
NodeJs
Redux / RTK
RTL and JEST
TailwindCSS / SaSS / Vanilla CSS
*react native
*graphql
*sql


=============================================================================================================
in approx 8 months:

Node js - mas comfy now than last year
TS - mas comfy now than last year
NextJS - mas comfy now than last year
Advanced hooks - mas comfy now than last year
React Mounting and rendering - mas comfy now than last year
Chrome dev tools - mas comfy now than last year
cookies and localstorage - mas comfy now than last year
MERN STACK - mas comfy now than last year
Custom Hooks - mas comfy now than last year

RTK - didnt know this last year
RTL and JEST - didnt know this last year
React Query / RTK Query / useSWR - didnt know this last year
Tailwind CSS - didnt know this last year
React Render - didnt know last year

if you think this is kulang then spend more time studying.
or create a better learning structure.
pero as per the roadmap, shoot naman. just need more of more i guess. imposter syndrome din.

===============================================================================================================

Stuff I learned this year that I didnt know before:

1. NodeJS - a little more comfortable with node.

2. TS - i know Basics and can use and read TS code now.

3. Testing - basics of testing except for mocking.

4. REACT
- render process
- advanced hooks - useMemo useCallback React.memo forwardRef
- deployment 

5. NextJS - intermediate
- next auth
- ssr
- client side

6. Redux Toolkit

7. React Query / RTK Query

8. localStorage and cookies

9. Testing - RTL and Jest

10. JWT , persist login

11. tailwind css

12. Chrome Dev Tools

13. A little AWS



================================================================================================================

Stuff i need to learn:

-graphql
-sql
-react native
-more node, ts, react, nextjs

advanced react patterns like render props, hocs, advanced hooks etc.

================================================================================================================
