React + Tailwind code commerce


1. create react app

2. clean up boilerplate

3. install tailwind
- in tailwind website => framework guide and choose framework (create-react-app)

 -- npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
 -- npx tailwindcss init -p
    -this will create tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.css
 
4. configure tailwind.config.js
- in content =>

 content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
 
5. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
- in index.css

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

6. start using tailwind


verdict.

good to know. seems a lot of people use it. but for me it's kind of the same with vanilla css. kinda messy for me.
havent really seen the purpose of using tailwind. but i kind of know how to use tailwind now. basically just css.
will keep an eye out for tailwind esp if really needed in most jobs. at least i know the basics of it now.
