2 forms of pre-rendering:
static generation and server-side rendering

how to fetch data:
getStaticProps - static generation
getServerSideProps - ssr



---Client Side Data Fetching:---
-it is not always that you need to pre-render data
ex. user dashboard page
 - it is private because it is behind a login screen, highly personalized or user-specific, seo not relevant
--no need to pre-render

so you will rely on client side data fetching!

you can use normal react useEffect or useSWR


**pre-rendering + client side data fetching**
ex. if you want seo plus request time data fetching => ssr with getServerSideProps
once data has been loaded, use client side data fetching to filter events
 vid 38 a little unclear need to rewatch***
 
 what is shallow routing?
 
 
 SUMMARY:
 PRE-RENDERING - generating html in advance for performance and SEO
 2 forms - static generation and serverside rendering
 
 STATIC GENERATION - html pages are built at build time and cached in a cdn 
 normal page - getStaticProps
 dynamic page - getStaticPAths
 fallback key - false true blocking
 --pages cannot be updated without full rebuild
 ---> incremental static regeneration and revalidate
 
 
 SSR - if you need to fetch data at request time and personalize data based on user incoming request
 getServerSideProps
 combined pre-rendering and client side data fetching
