NEXT JS LEARNING SO FAR:

1. ROUTING -

- file based routing
- nested routing 
- dynamic routing using [slugs]
- nested dynamic routing
- catch-all routes -- [...params].js --- study further!!

-Link Component for Routing
-programmatical routing - useRouter .push .replace


extra notes:
- useRouter hook built in with next js
- using of dynamic parameter passing to dynamic page
- _app.js is parent component rendered
- remembering how layout is used

****PAGES VS COMPONENTS
 page - use as a route
 component - not a route but reusable smaller 


2. PRE-RENDERING

-by default next pre-renders every page in the app
- this means nextjs generates the html in advance instead of it all done client side javascript.

- in React server sends emtpy html with root and and client runs js (hydration) then app becomes interactive


- in nextjs server generates html and send to client. then js runs (hydration) making the app interactive.

-Why pre-render?
 -improves performance
 -html already generated - loads faster
 -helps with SEO
 
Nextjs supports 2 types of pre-rendering:
1. Static Generation
2. Server-side rendering
