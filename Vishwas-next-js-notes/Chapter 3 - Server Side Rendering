 SERVER-SIDE RENDERING:
 
 
 some problems with static generation:
 -cannot fetch data at request time => stale data 
 -cant get access to incoming requests => personalization of feed based on user (twitter)
   -you could do it clientSide with useeffect but that means you miss out on SEO again.
 -cannot get data that is user specific and pre-render a page
 
 
SSR
- next allows you to pre-render a page not at build time but at request time
- html is generated for every incoming request
- form of pre-rendering where html is generated at request time.
- ssr is requuired when you need to fetch data per request and when you need to fetch personalized data keeping in mind SEO


HOW??
-how does next make it possible to fetch data at request time
-how it gets personalized data using incoming request


ssr is slower than ssg because data is fetched first, so use ssr only if necessary

getServerSideProps:
-will be called by the server on every request

1. runs only on the server side - will never run client side, wont be included in your js bundle
2. you can write code directly in getServerSideProps like fs module
3. is allowed only in a page, not in a regular component - used only for pre-rendering and not client side data fetching.
4. should return an object and should containt a props key which is also an object - this props object is then passed to page component for data fetched to be available to component
5. will run at request time


SSR with dynamic parameters---
